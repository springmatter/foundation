# Getting Started

Springmatter Foundation is a Vue plugin that enables rapid interface development using the Springmatter Design System.

## Install

```
yarn add @springmatter/foundation
```

## Import

Import the Foundation plugin into your main file and register it. This must be done before calling new Vue(), and it will also automatically include our CSS files.

```
import Foundation from "@springmatter/foundation";
Vue.use(Foundation);
```

All the components and CSS will be globally available to all Vue components under your root.
