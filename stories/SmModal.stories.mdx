# SmModal

A modal component with close event that fires when you click the background or the x button.

<Props of={SmModal} />

## Standard

The modal has one slot where you can put anything and it will show up in the window, which is pre-padded. The window can be any size within the predetermined range. To set the size, wrap your inner content in a `div` and set the size of the div.
